	<h1>Who</h1>
	
	<p style="background-image: url(wall/12.jpg);opacity:0.2; height:400px" > Mayday evolved from So Band which was formed by Ashin, Monster and the first drummer Qian You Da (錢佑達) in 1995 while they were studying in The Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University(師大附中). They were later joined by Masa and Stone, who were attending the same school. After graduation, the members went to different universities but continued to perform in pubs and eateries. They were also actively involved in promoting the growing rock music trend in Taiwan.[3] In 1997, the band registered under the moniker Mayday[1] in order to join the Formoz Festival (野台開唱). This would become the official name of the musical crew.<br><br>
	Mayday's songs are written mostly in Mandarin with some Taiwanese Hokkien tracks by Ashin, who speaks fluent Hokkien in addition to Mandarin. They are popular for their student band roots, and their ability to capture the zeitgeist of Taiwanese youth in the mid to late 1990s.[21] They are often cited as one of the pioneers of rock music in Taiwan.
	<br>
	Mayday's early style of music was characterised by raw music production that tended towards Hokkien garage rock tunes. They were also vocal advocates on the issue of gay rights, with several songs making oblique references to the issue.[22] As they gained popularity however, the band gradually shed its hard-edged sound and moved towards slicker production and sprawling anthemic songs.
	<br>
	Earlier lyrics written by Ashin centred around themes of teenage angst and growing up. However, in recent albums, Ashin has alluded to several cultural icons notably the Chinese mythical monkey-god Sun Wu-Kong, Mickey Mouse, Superman, Neil Armstrong and Che Guevara. Ashin has also cited movies and novels as inspiration for his songs including "Viva Love"  which was inspired by avant-garde Taiwanese director Tsai Ming Liang's 1994 movie, Vive L'Amourand the song "Armour" (武装) which was influenced by a Chinese drama 《孽子》and Haruki Murakami's novel, Kafka On the Shore.

	Mayday has made no secret of its admiration of the Beatles whom they cite as influencing their ideals of rock music.The eighth track of their fifth album has a track called John Lennon where the band espouses its dreams to become the "Beatles of the Chinese World". Other diverse musical influences include the Irish band U2, the British band Oasis, the Japanese pop music artists Mr. Children,[26] Sting as well as the Taiwanese rocker Wu Bai and China Blue.
