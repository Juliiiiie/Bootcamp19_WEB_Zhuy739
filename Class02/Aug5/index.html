      <li><p> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour a bundt cake pan.</p></li>
       <li><p> Combine sugar and eggs in a mixing bowl and use an electric mixer to mix for 1 minute. Add in flour and vanilla, then mix on medium speed for 8 minutes.</p></li>
       <li><p> Pour batter into cake pan and bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. (Cake will be very soft to the touch and register 200 degrees F on a thermometer.)</p></li>
       <li><p> Cool for 20-30 minutes, then invert onto a plate and cool completely.</p></li>
       <li><p> Serve with berries and cream or top with almond glaze, then berries.</p></li></p>

		<p color= "#3F6699"> His early works bear little resemblance to the style and direction that his music would later take. Wooden Polyurethane Papers, his first release, is a silly and playful collection of loosely constructed songs with a penchant for raw waveforms, simplistic synths, and low-quality samples. He followed this with Click Bleep Click, a 3-track EP consisting of much more complex compositions that tend toward bittersweet melodies, processed videogame samples, and field recordings from around Manhattan. This is an interesting entry within Nullsleep's discography as it shows a very different direction that could have been pursued, but was instead apparently abandoned. With his next two releases on 8bitpeoples, Hello World and The Gameboy Singles 2002, Nullsleep focused once again on playful simplicity. </p>-->
